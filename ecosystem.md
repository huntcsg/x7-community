# X7 Finance Ecosystem

🌟 **X7R**\
In order to attract as many interested parties into the ecosystem and ensure that the number of people that can benefit from this decentralized system is maximized, a deflationary “benefit” or “reward” token will exist that will receive buybacks, burns, and liquidity additions.

This token will be most interesting to retail investors that want to be exposed to the overall upside without significant effort on their part. At the start, this token will have a token fee associated with trading it, but it is expected that the DAO will lower that fee to zero once there is less need for ad-hoc manual capital injection.

This token is expected to eventually be traded on every major centralized exchange.

**Fee Allocation:**\

🌟 **X7DAO**\
Holders of X7DAO tokens will be able to vote on fee rates, loan terms, funding terms, tradable token tax terms, distribution of capital flows and any additional settings on and off chain. This includes the establishment of committees and other foundational efforts off chain.

🌟 **X7100 Constellation (X7101 - X7105)**\
A novel - eventually price consistent collection of five tokens. These act as the backstop to the Lending Pool. The X7100 series of tokens are burned on every transaction. While continually raising its floor price - it also provides further opportunities to mint new X7Deposit tokens.

<br>

🌟 **X7 NFTs**\
NFTs within the ecosystem will be used to provide opportunities for staking, lending, discounts, rewards, access to higher governance privileges & much more.
<br>
<br>

🌟 **X7D**\
With insurance of the investor at heart - individuals and institutions will hold these tokens just as they would underwrite treasury bills and other stable assets. Holders of X7D will be able to mint a time-based interest-bearing NFT. X7D is always exchangeable with Ethereum at a 1-to-1 ratio.

The X7 Finance protocol will only permit minting of new X7 Deposit tokens when on-chain reserves permit.
