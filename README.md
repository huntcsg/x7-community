# Welcome to X7 Finance

X7 is an ecosystem of innovative smart contracts that provide those with visionary ideas access to leveraged seed capital (e.g. Initial Liquidity Offerings, or ILOs) without lenders incurring the risk of losing the principal. This invention has massive implications not just for our users, but for all of DeFi ðŸ’¡

ðŸŒŸ At its core, leveraged ILOs means anyone with a good idea can raise 10-1000X the amount of Eth in their wallet to launch projects on XChange, our world-class DEX. ðŸŒŸ

âœ… Over time, the network effect of product launches will result in billions of dollars in trading volume on our Decentralized Exchange.\
âœ… The protocol will extend to other use case including but not limited to lending/borrowing, leveraged trading, liquidity locks, & more.\
âœ… A novel DAO governance structure + IPFS website ensures complete decentralization and censorship-resistance. #LongLiveDefi\
âœ… Our Telegram and Twitter are community-run, in the spirit of decentralization

<br>
ðŸ¥‡ We will consider this project a success once it captures at least 1% of the $100b daily trading volume on ETH.
<br>
<br>
There are many innovative technical and governance applications in this platform so we encourage you to dig and hop on this rocket ship! ðŸš€
<br>

> _"X7â€™s founding team believes that capital should be available to those with great ideas and that the unflinching reliability of code and distributed consensus can provide capital while eliminating significant downside risk."_

**First Initial Leveraged Liquidity DEX to launch**

Developers will be able to borrow initial liquidity to launch with for a small fee. This means projects can launch with more liquidity and will be very attractive for investors at the beginning.

The amount you will be able to borrow, depends on how much your capital is. The more you have, the more you will be able to borrow from the Lending Pool.

This is like a decentralized Bank on the Blockchain. Borrowing money for new projects without a risk, that profits everyone.

Everyone will be able to loan to the Lending Pool. Lock your ETH in the Lending Pool for 1 month RISK FREE and gain a specific % as reward on top of that when claiming that back (Just for example). This in turn makes the Lending Pool more liquid and helps with its growth and success.

> \_All profit from the DEX, goes back into the ecosystem (Tokens, Lending Pool, Future Development etc.). Pumping your bag!"
